# Switchboard

Your command center for Claude Code sessions.

Switchboard is a desktop app that gives you a unified view of all your Claude Code sessions across every project. Launch, resume, fork, and monitor sessions from a single window — no more juggling terminal tabs or digging through `~/.claude/projects` to find that one conversation from last week.

### Key Features

- **Session Browser** — All your Claude Code sessions, organized by project, searchable by content
- **Built-in Terminal** — Connect to running sessions or launch new ones without leaving the app
- **Status Notifications** — In-app alerts when a session is waiting for permission approval or user input
- **Fork & Resume** — Branch off from any point in a session's history
- **Full-Text Search** — Find any session by what was discussed, not just when it happened
- **Plans & Memory** — Browse and edit your plan files and CLAUDE.md memory in one place
- **Activity Stats** — Heatmap of your coding activity across all projects

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **npm** 10+
- Platform build tools for native modules:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - **Linux**: `build-essential`, `python3` (`sudo apt install build-essential python3`)
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools or `npm install -g windows-build-tools`

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (runs postinstall automatically)
npm install

# Start the app
npm start
```

`npm start` bundles CodeMirror and launches Electron. For faster iteration after the first run:

```bash
npm run electron
```

## Building

All build commands bundle CodeMirror first, then invoke electron-builder.

```bash
# Current platform
npm run build

# Platform-specific
npm run build:mac     # DMG + zip (arm64 + x64)
npm run build:win     # NSIS installer (x64 + arm64)
npm run build:linux   # AppImage + deb (x64 + arm64)
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

## Releasing

Releases are driven by git tags:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow builds for all platforms and publishes to GitHub Releases. You can also release locally:

```bash
npm run release   # builds + publishes to GitHub Releases
```

Set `GH_TOKEN` in your environment (a GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope).

## Auto-Updates

The app uses `electron-updater` to check for updates from GitHub Releases on launch and every 4 hours. Updates are only checked in packaged builds (not during development). The flow:

1. App auto-downloads updates in the background
2. A toast notification appears when the update is ready
3. User can restart immediately or dismiss (installs on next quit)

## Code Signing

For distribution, set these environment variables:

- **macOS**: `CSC_LINK` (p12 certificate) and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, or sign via Keychain
- **Windows**: `CSC_LINK` and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` for EV/OV code signing
- Set `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` to skip signing (CI artifact builds)

The macOS build uses custom entitlements (`build/entitlements.mac.plist`) to allow JIT and unsigned memory execution, required by native modules (node-pty, better-sqlite3).
